# Credit-Card-Validator

This project is a Credit Card Validator Website that uses the **Luhn Algorithm** to check the validity of a credit card number. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their card numbers and receive instant feedback on whether the card is valid or invalid.

# Features
- Interactive Web Interface: A clean and responsive design for easy user interaction.
- Luhn Algorithm Implementation: Validates credit card numbers using the widely recognized checksum algorithm.
- Real-Time Validation: Immediate feedback on card validity.
- Error Handling: Alerts users for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric characters.

# Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the web page.
- CSS: For styling and enhancing the visual appeal.
- JavaScript: For implementing the Luhn Algorithm and handling user interactions.

# How It Works
1. Users enter their credit card number in the input field.
2. The Luhn Algorithm processes the input to compute the checksum:
   - Odd-position digits are summed directly.
   - Even-position digits are doubled, and their resulting digits are summed.
3. The total checksum is checked for divisibility by 10.
4. If the checksum is divisible by 10, the card is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
5. A message is displayed to inform the user of the result.

# Use Case
This project can be used as:
- A learning tool for understanding the Luhn Algorithm.
- A template for integrating card validation into larger e-commerce or payment gateway systems.
